# AIM
To understand basics of C++
# THEORY
C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.C++ is a middle-level language, 
as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.
Primary or Build in data types: Integer type, Floating value, Double, Character ,String etc
Derived Data types: Arrays, Pointers etc
User defined data types: Classes, Structures etc
Before starting our main code we include some header files. For example #include which is a basic input output headrer file, we also include the namespace 'std'.

Some basic input output syntax are: To take input: cin>>variable_name; To give output:  cout<<variable_name;

 # EXPLANATION
 This is a basic program that has some variables that have values already initialized and some declared variables getting a value later on. We are taking input and printing that input. The line sizeof(variable_name) Tells us the size of the varible in bytes
