# Theory
C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.C++ is a middle-level language, 
as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.
Primary or Build in data types: Integer type, Floating value, Double, Character ,String etc
Derived Data types: Arrays, Pointers etc
User defined data types: Classes, Structures etc
Before starting our main code we include some header files. For example #include which is a basic input output headrer file, we also include the namespace 'std'.

Some basic input output syntax are: To take input: cin>>variable_name; To give output:  cout<<variable_name;
